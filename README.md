# Volatile Memory Forensics Exploring the critical role of analyzing system RAM in modern digital investigations.

## About the Project
Volatile memory forensics, also known as memory forensics, focuses on analyzing data stored in a computer’s RAM to uncover evidence of malicious activities. This project includes:

### A malware simulation (malware.py) that showcases how fileless malware can persist in memory.

### A detection script (Malware_detect.py) to identify and report suspicious processes running in memory.

## Why Volatile Memory Forensics?
Volatile memory forensics is a vital part of cybersecurity and digital investigations:

Detecting Elusive Threats: Many modern attacks, such as fileless malware, exist solely in memory, leaving no disk traces.

Understanding System Behavior: Memory snapshots reveal active processes, network connections, and more, offering a glimpse of a system’s real-time state.

Recovering Sensitive Data: RAM often contains encryption keys, credentials, and other data not saved to disk.

Building Forensic Timelines: Analyzing memory helps reconstruct sequences of events, shedding light on the scope and impact of attacks.
